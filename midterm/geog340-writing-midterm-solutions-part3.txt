											Key Concept Questions

 What are (at least) three ways the Land Ethic shifts previous thought about human- environment interaction?
==================
//
1. “Enlarges the boundaries of the community to include soils, waters, plants, and animals, or collectively: the land” (Leopold 1949, p. 239)
2. Extends social consciousness from people to the land
3. Changes man’s role from conqueror to citizen of the
ecological community
4. Shifts the basis for our relationship with the land/environment from economic self-interest to ethical obligation



 How is the concept of “community” central to Leopold’s development of the land ethic?
==================
//An interaction with nature ‘is right when it tends to preserve the integrity, stability, and beauty of the biotic community’ and ‘is wrong when it tends otherwise

//Leopold also talks about ethics between people and their communities, citing the examples of the Golden Rule (do unto others as you would do unto yourself) and the concept of democracy as foundations that inform our societal code of conduct. The land ethic, Leopold argues, is the missing piece in what he calls the ethical sequence.


 How can we balance economic profit and environmental protection? Examples?
==================
(guess)
"google" 
// Assess whether it is possible to balance the pursuit of economic prosperity without compromising on environmental conservation. Many pragmatists and realists believe that both economic growth and environment concerns cannot coexist peacefully

examples: the amazon.. fifth of oxygen supplt land expanding, meadow saving from pine trees

 What are ways in which contemporary society displays a Land Ethic? What are ways in which it fails to do so?
==================
(guess maybe)
// The land ethic is based on:
◦ the field of ecology, the study of the interactions between organisms and their environment
◦ Moral extensionism – the expansion of ethics beyond humans to land, plants, animals, etc.
◦ Placing humans as part of the environment, rather than separate from it 
◦ Ecocentric VS Anthopocentric


 Establishes the right of the natural world to exist outside of its utility to humans (Leopold!)
 -Limitations?
     - Accepts and codifies the nature / human binary 
     - Cleaves “reality” into two categories (wild or non-wild)
    

 What are two founding beliefs about nature in Western philosophy?
==================
//
1. Humans are separate and superior to nature (Biblical Tradition) 
2. Nature only has value as it is useful to humans (John Locke)


 What are three competing theories of the relationship between population growth and environmental change?
==================
//
1. Geometric Population Growth (Malthusian) Theory
2. IPAT (Neo-Malthusian) Theory (Population, Development, and Environmental Impact )
3. Population & Innovation (Cornucopian) Theory


//Perspective 1: “Geometric” Growth ///////////////

Thomas Malthus argued that:
• •
Population grows exponentially – 2,4,8,16,32
But,resources grow linearly – 2,4,6,8,10
Thomas Malthus (1766-1834)

Therefore, population will outgrow food supply
Following this perspective, disease, famine, and war are natural corrections to slow down rapid population growth

	Population, Violence, and Injustice
Malthus called for greater restraints on women, but it has been shown that expanding women’s rights (ex. education, reproductive choices) actually slows population growth
Malthusian thinking has led to population control efforts that target the poorest and most marginal populations, even though the poorest are often not the primary cause of degradation
	– Example: India’s forced sterilization program
		Targeting the poor and women diverts attention away from systemic causes of degradation
	– Ex: wildly uneven levels of consumption!

///////////////////////////////////////////

// Perspective 2: Population, Development, and Environmental Impact
	(IPAT (Neo-Malthusian) Theory)

•• Neo-Malthusians maintain that population is the factor that has the greatest impact on the environment, but that the effects of population are mediated by differences in lifestyle

Ehrlich and Holdren (1974) tried to account for
these differences with the I=PAT equation
	• I = impact on the environment
	• P = population(often density)
	• A = affluence (GDP or GNP per capita)
– Wealthier people tend to consume more resources
	• T = technology (energy consumption per capita)
– Technology can either reduce environmental impacts (Ehrlich and Holdren, 1974) or increase them (Commoner, 1988)

•• Ecological footprint – the theoretical spatial extent of the earth’s surface required to sustain an individual, group, system, or organization


Carrying capacity is the population of human or non-human organisms that could be sustained in an area over time
	– Depends on the amount of consumption of the organisms (lifestyle, for humans)
	– Determined in part by the ecological footprint of the organisms

	Critiques of Carrying Capacity
May be used to justify racist or xenophobic policies, such as refusing to accept migrants and refugees (ex. Australia)
	– The discourse of “carrying capacity” makes it seem as though there is a “natural” limit on how many people can be supported by a country, rather than a serious look at the consumption patterns of over-consumers

// Perspective 3: Population and Innovation ///////////////
“Cornucopian” population theorists see population as a resource rather than a problem (e.g., Ester Boserup, 1965)
	– When resources are scarce, people will innovate
	– More people means more brains and hands working to
solve problems
	– Example: Induced intensification of agriculture, such as the techniques invented during the Green Revolution, led to greater crop yields

Critiques of Cornucopian thinking: 
Ex: Costs of the Green Revolution

 Ignores the scale of processes such as food production
	– Different impacts on local communities compared to distant markets
	• Some innovations increased agricultural food supply but damaged other ecosystems (especially aquatic ones)
	• More food may be produced than is needed, but it is not distributed evenly

 How does the Neo-Malthusian/IPAT perspective differ from the original
Malthusian/geometric growth perspective of population-environment relations?
==================
// Neo-Malthusians maintain that population is the factor that has the greatest impact on the environment, but that the effects of population are mediated by differences in lifestyle.
- Introduction of, I=PAT and applications of I=PAT such as the Ecological footprint.
- Malthusian perspective emphasises that the population is the major factor impacting the environment.


 What are principles of successful management of the commons?
==================
// Collective Action
- Individuals have incentives to participate in collective ownership if they have the ability to negotiate the rules
- Successful commons management includes:
	• Clearly defined boundaries
	• Costs of managing should match benefits gained (proportionality) • Rules are made collectively by users (collective choice)
	• Monitoring systems are in place
	• Sanctions must be in place to punish violators
	• Conflict resolution mechanisms must exist
	• The system must have autonomy (local, self-governance)

 What are 3 examples of market-based solutions to environmental problems?
==================
// market-based solutions to environmental problems
1. Green taxes - individual or firms partcipatat in "greener" behavior by avoiding more costly "brown" alternatives,
			   - market component (incentivized behavior), 
			   - the Role of the state *sets and collect taxes

2. Cap and trade - Total amount of pollulant or other "bad" is limited and tradable rightsto pollute are distributed to polluters,
 				 - market component (rewarding efficiency), 
 				 - the Role of the state *set limits and enforces contracts

3. Green Consumption - Individual consumers choose goods or services based on their certified enviromental impacts, typically pating more for benign commodities, 
					 - market component (willingness to pay), 
					 - the Role of the state *oversees and authenicates claims of producers and sellers

 What are 3 critiques of market environmentalism?
==================
// 3- 4 critiques of market environmentalism
1. Non-Market Values:
– Should everything be in a market?
– Conflicts between Anthropocentric vs. Ecocentric perspectives – Intrinsic (non-market) values of nature needs to pay attention to
– Addressing environmental disaster issues, quick actions to avert.

2. Money and Nature
– A market or commodity approach to the environment is based on the exchange of discrete and specific items or services
– But, in the real world, ecosystems are very complex and ecological functions are connected and interdependent

3. Equity and Rights:
– Economic injustice -> Environmental injustice
• **“A market system gives power to those most able to pay”** (Beder 1996, pg. 61)
– It is not possible to include everyone who might be affected by environmental problems.
– Getting connected hundreds,thousands,or billions of people to negotiate. (difficult)
– Future generations cannot be involved in bargaining (not born yet)
– Marginalized people are routinely excluded from decisions that affect them

4. Assumes Humans will act Rationally to Changes
— “[In a Market Response Model] price signals are translated into adaptations
by rational and creative people in the market, providing abundance under conditions of scarcity.”
— Do we behave rationally as consumers? Need to find ways to behave rationally as consumers.
— Are we marketed to as rational consumers? Marketing to projected audience, rational consumers.

 What are the 2 contradictions of capitalism from the political economy perspective?
==================
// Two contraditions:
1. The first contradiction of capitalism:
– Over-Accumulation – wealth is concentrated in the hands of a few, so many cannot afford to buy commodities and keep the system expanding

2. The second contradiction of capitalism:
– capitalism undermines itself by destroying the conditions
necessary for its own survival through:
• ***Environmental degradation*** and ***worker exploitation*** –
harms the [conditions of production] and worker health
• Over-extraction of resources – produces scarcity that limits
growth

 How do neoliberal principles shift how the environment is perceived and managed?
==================
// (guess)
def: Neoliberalism or neo-liberalism is the 20th-century resurgence of 19th-century ideas associated with laissez-faire economic liberalism and free market capitalism. 

- The insights of Karl Marx can be used to describe how capitalist economic systems produce environmental problems.

-Fiduciary Duty: an obligation to act in the best interest of another party. In terms of Capitalism: a corporation's board member has a fiduciary duty to the shareholder

- evolution, to A modified form of liberalism tending to favor free- market capitalism. (neoliberalism)
